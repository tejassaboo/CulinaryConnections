# Culinary Connections

Culinary Connections creates opportunities for employees to connect over food, increasing workplace culture and efficiency. We were inspired by our mutual love for food and the many occasions where we have connected with peers and professionals over a meal. This would be the perfect solution for corporate settings - it would open up the opportunity to meet new friends or reconnect with old ones.
